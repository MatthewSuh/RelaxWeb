        Since 2007, the American Psychological Association has commissioned an annual nationwide survey as part of its Mind/Body
        Health campaign to examine the state of stress across the country and understand its impact. The Stress in America™
        survey measures attitudes and perceptions of stress among the general public and identifies leading sources of stress,
        common behaviors used to manage stress and the impact of stress on our lives. The results of the survey draw attention
        to the serious physical and emotional implications of stress and the inextricable link between the mind and body.
        <br>
        <br>The 2016 presidential election season proved to be a somewhat or very significant source of stress for more than
        half of Americans (52 percent), as suggested by last year’s survey results. In the August 2017 survey, while money
        (62 percent) and work (61 percent) remain common stressors for Americans, slightly more Americans report significant
        stress about the future of our nation (63 percent).1 A significant majority of adults from both political parties
        say they feel stress about the future of our nation, though the number is significantly higher for Democrats (73
        percent) than for Republicans (56 percent) and Independents (59 percent). And nearly six in 10 adults (59 percent)
        report that the current social divisiveness causes them stress when thinking about the nation.</p>
